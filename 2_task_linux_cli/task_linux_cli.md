# Linux CLI and Networking

## Linux CLI and Networking
I've finished the [Linux Survival (4 modules)](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/). I'm Windows User right now, so the first two blocks were the most useful for me. I've learned new commands to use CLI more efficiently.
Despite the fact, I've finished all of the modules (tried some Linux commands on my friends' PC). I will look through it later one more time If I decide to switch to Linux. Because probably I'll forget some of them later.

## HTTP Protocol
I've read two following articles. As I'm a beginner, it was a bit challenging to cope with all the terms but, I understood the mechanism of communication between hosts and clients, what are verbs and status codes, general headers, entity headers, request and response formats, and security.
I will re-read it after I have a bit of practice so it could be even more clear.
