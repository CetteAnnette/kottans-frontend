# Git Basics

## 1. Version Control with Git 
I'm totally new to Git, so this Udacity course gave me a good basis. It was my first experience with shell (Hooray!). This particular course was very approachable and beginner-friendly. It helped me to:
1. ...understand the mechanism of the version-control system;
2. ...get the main set of commands to start working with Git;

## 2. Complete the following levels at learngitbranching.js.org
Oops! I've done a bit more than needed (the last level was too much for me right now, so I'll get back to it). It was an interesting experience! Thank you!
